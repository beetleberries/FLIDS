##      Opel Astra CAN Bus data            ##
#############################################

Description:
This folder contains various datasets of CAN bus data for the car Opel Astra.
Certain datasets (see 'Normal data') have not been modified, while the attack datasets (see below 'Áttack data') have been modified to contain specific CAN bus attacks. 

First we captured the normal data while driving the car in urban environment, with a laptop and a CAN-to-USB interface (CANtact) connected to the OBD-II port.
Data captured with the tool candump from the canutil tool suit.

Since we could not attack our car directly, we modified manually some of the data to create datasets of CAN bus attacks.

This collection of datasets is made for research purposes in the field of Intrusion Detection Systems for CAN bus.

#############################################
Attack data
#############################################

These datasets have been created by modifying copies of the testing dataset.
Each copy presents a specific CAN bus attack, as described below.
For injection-based attacks, we added packets manually and adjusted timestamps accordingly.

diagnostic.log:
The attack consists in injecting 10 messages with CAN ID between the values '700' and '7FF', as described in Woo's paper*.

dosattack.log:
The attack consists in injecting messages with CAN ID '000' (highest priority) for 10 seconds.
It simulates a flood of a 500 Kpbs CAN bus. 
We replace all messages in a block of 10 seconds with high priority CAN messages sent at a rate of 4 packets per milliseconds.
Format of the packets injected: 000#0000000000000000
Total number of packet injected: 40016
Start of attack: line 122976
First packet : (1536574995.000091) slcan0 000#0000000000000000
End of attack: line 162990
Last packet : (1536575004.999811) slcan0 000#0000000000000000


fuzzing_canid.log:
The attack consists in injecting a total of 10 messages with CAN ID values that are not part of the legitimate values (i.e., CAN ID values not seen in normal traffic)
Injected packets:
